FUser: Hi, I've heard you're the best in business. Can we discuss a job?

Hitman (aka "Viper"): What makes you think that? And what kind of job are we talking about?

User: A... personal matter. Someone who's been causing me trouble.

Viper: That sounds like a lot to take care of yourself. Who is it, and why do they need to be taken out?

User: It's my business partner. He's trying to cut me out of the company I co-founded together.

Viper: Sounds like you've got some unfinished business with him then. What makes you think he'll go quietly into retirement? 

User: Honestly, no idea. That's why I need someone who can take care of it for me discreetly.

Viper: Alright, let's say we could make that happen... How much are you willing to pay?

User: As high as necessary
